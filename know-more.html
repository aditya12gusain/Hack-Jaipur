            If you think Chandigarh is the first-ever planned city in India,
            then you certainly need to correct your facts. Jaipur is believed to
            be the first planned city in the country as it was completed in the
            year 1730. The fact that Jaipur is the only city that has been
            planned as per the rules and regulations of the Vastu Shastra and
            the Shilpa Shastra will certainly amaze you. Did you know that
            Jaipur was constructed within a period of 4 years?

            Over a period of time, Hawa Mahal has become one of the most
            recognised historical monuments in India. Hence, it is a synonym to
            Jaipur today. Therefore, a trip to Jaipur is always considered
            incomplete without capturing the captivating beauty of this grand
            structure. Do you know this architectural marvel has a total of 953
            windows? Yes, you read that right. It is called Hawa Mahal (the
            Breeze Palace) for a reason.

            Jantar Mantar is one of the two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in
            Jaipur, the other being the Amer Fort. Therefore, it has gained
            popularity all over the world. It is a complex of 19 architectural
            astronomical instruments which were built in the year 1734 by the
            king of Jaipur so that astronomical positions of the solar system
            could be observed with the naked eye. Hence, it wouldn't be wrong to
            call it one of the architectural wonders of the world.

            For Jaipur, which has been touted as one of the royal cities in
            India, housing luxurious and lavish hotels is common. But do you

            presidential suite for about US$ 50,000. Well, this is something not

            We all know Jaipur as the Pink City. But have you ever wondered how
            the name "Pink City" captured the frame? To your surprise, the city
            was painted entirely in pink colour in order to honour and welcome
            the visit of Edward, the Prince of Wales. It was done in the year
            1876 by Maharaja Ram Singh and since then, Jaipur has been called
            the Pink City of India.
